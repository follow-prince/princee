## Introduction
The "Princee" Flutter app is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Firebase. The app provides an authentication system and redirects users to the home page if they are logged in; otherwise, it takes them to the login page. The project follows the MIT License, granting permission for others to use, modify, and distribute the software.

## Installation and Setup
To download and access the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the "Princee" repository from GitHub using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/follow-prince/Princee.git
   ```


2. **Flutter Installation**: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your system. If you don't have Flutter installed, follow the official Flutter installation guide (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your operating system.

3. **Firebase Configuration**: Since the project uses Firebase, you need to set up a Firebase project and obtain the configuration information (API Key, App ID, Messaging Sender ID, Project ID). Replace the corresponding values in the `lib/main.dart` file with your Firebase configuration.

4. **Dependencies**: The project depends on Firebase and other Flutter packages. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
